 <h2>Shahina KV</h2>
 <h3>Vision</h3>
<p>According to me <b>SheHacks</b> is a space to improve my skills. The main factor that I attracted to<br> this course is our team get a separate mentor to focus and guide our journey.As a beginner it is<br>very useful to study program codes and project submission. So I very much interested to join this<br> bootcamp. I beleive that tinkerhub is the best place to learn,build and grow. </p>

<p>Personally, I think <b>SheHacks</b> mainly for skill development.In this series, i believe that<br> we can up our skill and learn coding more deeply. And the way of learning is a mentor to support.<br>This also make us confident.
To emphasize it is beginner friendly, short duration hacks series.<br> And also get goodies. This is iam interested joining the bootcamp. </p>
